// This is the basic game board. Each row houses 3 columns. Each of these columns can take 
//a single string or char: "x" or "o". The ability for the player to insert their string is
//written later in the code, as well as any win/tie checks.

function board(){
    const gameBoard=new Array(9)
    console.log(gameBoard)
